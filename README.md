Project Idea
We want to create a social media platform that serves as a supportive community for individuals seeking to overcome various addictions. The platform will facilitate connections, provide resources, and offer tools tailored to the needs of people at different stages of their recovery journey. We aim to have direct messaging between users and groups, along with status updates, recovery tracking, and access to emergency support features for users in critical need.

Motivation for the Application
As undergrad college students we can safely say that college is pretty tough as it functions as the intersection between youth and adulthood. It’s a rough time where students are often juggling academic performance with career development alongside an important stage of their personal relationships. It’s also a time where many students unfortunately fall into and develop addictions. Whether it be drugs or alcohol, to less recognized issues like social media and overall internet addiction, ,any students feel alienated when dealing with these issues and do not know where to find the resources and help they need to overcome these challenges. Our goal is directly address this concern and provide students with the tools and support they need to conquer the various challenges throughout their walk of life.

Who would use the application?
As mentioned before, our target audience is primarily people who are of college age or older. A lot of these addictions tend to be more on the adult side of issues, so we would like to avoid younger audiences.

Is there a need or want in the market it fulfills?
There is a lack of effective mental health and productivity platforms in the market. The ones that do exist tend to be more generalized while we aim to focus on concerns that students in college commonly deal with.

What technologies do you plan on using?
We plan to use the MERN stack with firebase. We are unsure of whether or not we want to stick to a web platform or go cross platform on iOS and Android so we will use React/React Native depending on the finalized features. For the backend we will use Node.JS and Express.JS. For our external database and general hosting we will use firebase’s firestore database.

Are there similar applications or competitors available now? How does your idea differ? Or why is there a need for a competitor?
There isn’t an exact competitor to our application. Productivity apps like Habitify allow you to track your habits and work on goals so that you can improve. Mental health apps like Sanvelo provide tools and resources to deal with mental health issues. Our idea somewhat combines the likes of these apps together into a singular platform with a live community that users can rely on.

What public API(s) will you be utilizing? How do you plan on utilizing the API? You must use at least one API.
SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) API - Provides information on treatment facilities and resources for substance abuse and mental health issues. Nutritionix API - Offers comprehensive nutritional data, helping users maintain a healthy diet during their recovery process.
